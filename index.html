    <p> A fried egg is a cooked dish made from one or more eggs which are removed from their shells
      <br> and placed into a frying pan and fried with minimal accompaniment. Fried eggs are traditionally
      <br> eaten for breakfast in many countries but may also be served at other times of the day.</p>

<br>
<p>Boiled eggs are eggs, typically from a chicken, cooked with their shells unbroken,
  <br> usually by immersion in boiling water. Hard-boiled eggs are cooked so that the
  <br> egg white and egg yolk both solidify, while soft-boiled eggs may leave the yolk,
  <br> and sometimes the white, at least partially liquid and raw.</p>
